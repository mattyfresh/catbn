```
install Elm
run elm-make
have your mind blown
```

Run this command from the root project dir to recompile your Elm code on save:

```
./bin/watch
```

It takes in an elm file using `fswatch`, which you can find via your preferred package manager
(I used `homebrew`), and then compiles a JS file for you to include on your page.

@TODO Install `Gulp` or maybe `webpack` to handle all of our compiling/dev needs.
